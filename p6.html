          <p><h1>MOS Training</h1></p>
          <p>Recently a lot of people have been asking me "how can a jumpstart my career in IT?", and to be honest there is only one real answer to that. "Get some certs!" Now, certification training is beyond overwhelming. There are certs for everything. Security, Networking, programming... and while the certificate training alone won't hand you a job, it will add a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-benefits.aspx" target="_blank">professional edge</a> and a globally recognized industry endorsed skill set to your resume. For instance the easiest and first certification anyone interested in boosting their administrative or business career (even outside of IT) is obtaining a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mos-certification.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Office Specialist Certification</a>. The MOS is designed to give you the oppurtunity to demonstrate strong skill levels in all of Microsoft Office's Suite and 'Holding a MOS certification can earn an entry-level business employee as much as $16,000 more in annual salary than uncertified peers.'</p>
          <p>"How do I get started?" Well, there of course are paid classes at colleges you can take, paid online classes,  and even one-on-one paid sessions with Microsoft Proffesionals. Depending on your time and financial situation there are also a wide variety of FREE online learning materials and tutorials that you can use at your disposal and quite frankly, WHY WOULDN'T YOU! So go! Grab some coffee and invest some time (money if you desire) into jumpstarting that career:</p>
