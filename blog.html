          <p><h1>Windows Wrenching</h1></p>
          <p>These days I haven’t spent much personal time on Windows, but I still get asked to do the occasional clean/speed boost/tune-up, whatever you want to call it, on someones Windows PC. This blog post is about my technique that I use to preform these simple tasks to keep any Windows PC cleaner, quicker, and as secure as it can be without running globs of BATCH files, and keeping it fairly simple. So if you can follow these simple steps you too can tune any Windows PC to run a little faster, a little smoother, and a little more private.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Complete all Windows, Java, Adobe updates.</strong> This will make sure your computer is running the latest, bug patched, security patched services available to your machine. I like to schedule updates at night, or manually add them when I know I’m not going to be using the machine. Sometimes, having automatic updates can be a burden when you need to gain access to information quickly, turn on the computer, only to see that spinning update loading screen that Windows uses to tell you “this is going to be a while…”</p>
          <p><strong>*Remove your 3rd Party Antivirus.</strong> Did you buy Antivirus with your computer? Are you paying a monthly or yearly fee associated with a bloated Antivirus? If you have a solid backup solution, there might be an argument to remove your 3rd Party Antivirus all together. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/antivirus-is-bad/">"It Might Be Time to Stop Using Antivirus" - arsTECHNICA</a>. Windows Defender is a security system packaged with Windows and is already on your computer. There are various competing threats on your computer literally every second. Virus’, root kits, malware.. the list goes on however, no one has a biggest interest in your computers health than Windows itself and relying on third-party antivirus is the biggest scam being sold with Windows Computers to date. Antivirus companies like Symantec, subsidize the cost of the computer by offering software being shipped with the computer. These Antivirus programs can act like viruses themselves competing simultaneously with Windows defender and detect eachother as threats, damand higher and higher levels of resources, slowing down system startup and shutdowns, and delaying Windows Updates and eat your battery life.
          </p>
          <p>The good news is there are many great free Antivirus programs that offer great monitoring and scanning that don't keep your system hostage. So please, at the very least research your current Antivirus if you are experiencing problems, because easiest, most secure and widely used way to clean/speed boost/tune-up is a OS wipe and if you don't already have a solid back-up, or safe initialization restore point, that may be the only option.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Remove Unwanted Startup Applications.</strong> Another popular problem is the slowing down of a systems startup overtime. Now, a lot of this has to do with planned obsolescence and services requiring more resources over time, but there are some steps that you can take to help subtract some seconds or minutes from your machines startup time. Remove Unwanted Startup Items. There are multiple ways to preform this task:</p>
        </article>
      </div>
      <div id="highlightedItem">
        <p><i>[1] Remove startup items through Task Manager: [Right-Click the Windows Start button and select Task Manager] or [press Ctrl, Shift, Esc] or [right-click on the empty space of the taskbar, click Task Manger]. When Task Manager is open, click ‘more details’ at the bottom of the window. Click on the Startup tab, right-click on suspect application and select Disable from the pop-up window.</p>
        <p>[2] Remove startup items from Startup Folder: press the Windows Key (next to space bar) and R key simultaneously to open Run command box window. Type “shell:startup” and press Enter key to open the Startup folder. Then press Ctrl-A to select all items in the folder then press the Delete Key.</i>

            <p><h1>MOS Training</h1></p>
            <p>Recently a lot of people have been asking me "how can a jumpstart my career in IT?", and to be honest there is only one real answer to that. "Get some certs!" Now, certification training is beyond overwhelming. There are certs for everything. Security, Networking, programming... and while the certificate training alone won't hand you a job, it will add a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-benefits.aspx">professional edge</a> and a globally recognized industry endorsed skill set to your resume. For instance the easiest and first certification anyone interested in boosting their administrative or business career (even outside of IT) is obtaining a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mos-certification.aspx">Microsoft Office Specialist Certification</a>. The MOS is designed to give you the oppurtunity to demonstrate strong skill levels in all of Microsoft Office's Suite and 'Holding a MOS certification can earn an entry-level business employee as much as $16,000 more in annual salary than uncertified peers.*'
          </p>
          <p>"How do I get started?" Well, there of course are paid classes at colleges you can take, paid online classes,  and even one-on-one paid sessions with Microsoft Proffesionals. Depending on your time and financial situation there are also a wide variety of FREE online learning materials and tutorials that you can use at your disposal and quite frankly, WHY WOULDN'T YOU!
          So go! Grab some coffee and invest some time (money if you desire) into jumpstarting that career:</p>

          <p><h1>Why Apple?</h1></p>
          <p>Apple hate has subsided in recent years but that doesn't mean iPhone users still don't encounter the <i>"Apple products are so overpriced"</i> and <i>"iPhones suck"</i> brilliant arguments from IT professionals and jerks alike. Now I am a fan of all technology. I love innovation. I love usable features (not gimmicks). I love Apple products and MacOS but that doesn't mean that I am also uncritical of their missteps and shortcomings.</p>
          <p>Here are some of the answers that I give when people ask me "why Apple?" Apple products hold their value. If your unsure go on eBay and see how much a 3 year old iPhone 7 will fetch you used. And then, look any 3 year old Android phone from any of the manufactures. Apple products have been in demand, and retain up to 70% of their retail value within 3 years of their release. This is unheard of anywhere in tech.</p>
          <p>Security. Apple is a hardware manufacturer, software company, and service provider. They are however not a data corporation. Apple does not care about or want your data. Therefore, when you buy from Apple you are a customer buying a product. When you buy from other manufacturers you are not the customer, YOU ARE THE PRODUCT! Anytime a manufacturer uses subsidies and offloads services to Google, you lose. Period.
          Because of this philosophy Apple protects its products and its users inherently.
          <a href="https://developer.apple.com/security/">Apple Security Page</a></p>
          <p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330">We should talk about t2 chips.</a>
          Worry no more if your MacBook gets stolen. It will be rendered useless in other peoples hands, making it less desirable for thief's.
          The T2 chip makes it possible to enable Secure Boot which verifies the integrity of your machines startup disk operating systems INCLUDING installations of Windows! That is a sign of a company who views you as a desirable customer, not dump for an algorithm to advertise to.
          Im not even going to go into iOS in the post but if your interested parse through the <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf">iOS Security Guide</a> if you are at all thinking Apple is evil and overpriced. Just the fact they make this information available is a great thing for tech companies and their transparency.

          <p><h1>PA Siri</h1></p>
          <p>Like most people, I don’t answer my phone unless I recognize the number or am expecting a call. And with iOS’ voicemail transcribe service, it’s even easier to be an introverted recluse. Hooray! And if you’re a self depreciating introverted recluse like me, you don’t like the sound of your recorded voice. Luckily, not only can iOS transcribe your voicemails, but Siri can even record the greeting to your voicemail box.</p>
          <p>No, unfortunately there is no button to push to activate this feature yet, but you can get ahead of the curve and set Siri as your personal assistant yourself with a few steps involving iOS’ Speech Accessibility features. First you need to enable this accessibility feature.</p>
          <p>What you will need: 2 Siri enabled apple devices, your phone to record the greeting and a separate device to speak the greeting message. It is possible to record Siri’s output with the ‘Voice Memo’ app, but the quality will be unacceptable in my opinion.</p>
          <p>Let’s get started!</p>
          <div id="highlightedItem">
            <p>Activate Speech Accessibility:</p>
            <p>Navigate to [Settings>General>Accessibility>Speech].</p>
          </div>
          <p>Here you can enable two useful features. The first option ’Speak Selection” enables Siri to literally speak any selected text on your device. When you select or select-all any text on your screen, parse over and click ‘speak’ in the context menu. This maybe a better option if you don’t like utilizing all of iOS’ multitouch features. The second option ‘Speak Screen’ enables Siri to speak the entire screen by swiping down from the top of the screen with 2 fingers. This option will enable Siri to speak all the text in the active window of the screen or selected test. This is the faster most preferred method.</p>
          <p>So go ahead and try it out! Open a new note in the Notes app, and make Siri say anything… Okay, play for a minute. Make *it say some inappropriate things….</p>
          <p>Get that out of your system? Good. Now, write a greeting message. Something like, “Hello, you have reached John Doe. This is Siri, his personal virtual assistant. John cannot answer the phone right now so if you leave a name, brief message, or text, he will get back to you as soon as possible.” Play it a few times, add some extra punctuation for fluidity and proper speech pattern timing.</p>
          <div id="highlightedItem">
            <p><strong>Record Greeting:</strong></p>
            <p>Navigate to [Phone>Voicemail>Greeting]</p>
          </div>
          <p>Enjoy Siri as your new PA!</p>

          <p><h1>Git and Radiohead</h1></p>
          <p>For the last few days I've been struggling with the concept of GIT. For those you are not familiar (I am barely) GIT is a Version Control System. A VCS is a way to track the changes is a computer file and coordinate work between multiple people. Basically, a way for multiple people to work on the same source material without overwriting it. I have just added this site to my git repo and will be updating it more periodically.</p>
          <p>Last night I saw Radiohead for the first time, live. I have been a fan for a while and hearing their music live was immersive. Their use of instrumentation really sets them apart from any band I've seen live. Though I personally wished to see 'lotus flower' and 'reckoner' performed they did a great job of spanning their almost 30 year carreer in music. My favorite part of the night was when they performed 'idioteque' which has the perfect balance of all of the reasons I love Radiohead, a driving rythmic bassline, breakbeat sounding drums and an atmospheric melody. It was an honor to see them and I hope they come back to Philadelphia soon, and don't wait another 6 years before doing so.
