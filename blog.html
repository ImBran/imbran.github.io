        <h2><a name="bpost1">[June 12, 2018] - MOS Training:</a></h2>
          <p>Recently a lot of people have been asking me "how can a jumpstart my career in IT?", and to be honest there is only one real answer to that. "Get some certs!" Now, certification training is beyond overwhelming. There are certs for everything. Security, Networking, programming... and while the certificate training alone won't hand you a job, it will add a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-benefits.aspx">professional edge</a> and a globally recognized industry endorsed skill set to your resume. For instance the easiest and first certification anyone interested in boosting thier administrative or business career (even outside of IT) is obtaining a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mos-certification.aspx">Microsoft Office Specialist Certification</a>. The MOS is designed to give you the oppurtunity to demonstrate strong skill levels in all of Microsoft Office's Suite and 'Holding a MOS certification can earn an entry-level business employee as much as $16,000 more in annual salary than uncertified peers.*'
          <br>
          <br>
          "How do I get started?" Well, there of course are paid classes at colleges you can take, paid online classes,  and even one-on-one paid sessions with Microsoft Proffesionals. Depending on your time and financial situation there are also a wide variety of FREE online learning materials and tutorials that you can use at your disposal and quite frankly, WHY WOULDN'T YOU!
          <br>
          <br>
          So go! Grab some coffee and invest some time (money if you desire) into jumpstarting that career:

          <h2><a name="bpost2">[June 3, 2018] - Why Apple?</a></h2>
          <p>Apple hate has subsided in recent years but that doesn't mean iPhone users still don't encounter the <i>"Apple products are so overpriced"</i> and <i>"iPhones suck"</i> brilliant arguments from IT professionals and jerks alike. Now I am a fan of all technology. I love innovation. I love usable features (not gimmicks). I love Apple products and MacOS but that doesn't mean that I am also uncritical of their missteps and shortcomings.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here are some of the answers that I give when people ask me "why Apple?" Apple products hold their value. If your unsure go on eBay and see how much a 3 year old iPhone 7 will fetch you used. And then, look any 3 year old Android phone from any of the manufactures. Apple products have been in demand, and retain up to 70% of their retail value within 3 years of their release. This is unheard of anywhere in tech.
            <br>
            <br>
            Security. Apple is a hardware manufacturer, software company, and service provider. They are however not a data corporation. Apple does not care about or want your data. Therefore, when you buy from Apple you are a customer buying a product. When you buy from other manufacturers you are not the customer, YOU ARE THE PRODUCT! Anytime a manufacturer uses subsidies and offloads services to Google, you lose. Period.
            <br>
            <br>
            Because of this philosophy Apple protects its products and its users inherently. Just read through
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/security/">Apple Security Page</a>
            and you start to see the disparity between Apple and everyone else.
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330">We should talk about t2 chips.</a>
            Worry no more if your MacBook gets stolen. It will be rendered useless in other peoples hands, making it less desirable for thief's.
            The T2 chip makes it possible to enable Secure Boot which verifies the integrity of your machines startup disk operating systems INCLUDING installations of Windows! That is a sign of a company who views you as a desirable customer, not dump for an algorithm to advertise to.
            <br><br>
            Im not even going to go into iOS in the post but if your interested parse through the <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf">iOS Security Guide</a> if you are at all thinking Apple is evil and overpriced. Just the fact they make this information available is a great thing for tech companies and their transparency.

        <h2><a name="bpost3">[August 1, 2018] - Git and Radiohead</a></h2>
        <p>
          For the last few days I've been struggling with the concept of GIT. For those you are not familiar (I am barely) GIT is a Version Control System. A VCS is a way to track the changes is a computer file and coordinate work between multiple people. Basically, a way for multiple people to work on the same source material without overwriting it. I have just added this site to my git repo and will be updating it more periodically.
          <br>Last night I saw Radiohead for the first time, live. I have been a fan for a while and hearing their music live was immersive. Their use of instrumentation really sets them apart from any band I've seen live. Though I personally wished to see 'lotus flower' and 'reckoner' performed they did a great job of spanning their almost 30 year carreer in music. My favorite part of the night was when they performed 'idioteque' which has the perfect balance of all of the reasons I love Radiohead, a driving rythmic bassline, breakbeat sounding drums and an atmospheric melody. It was an honor to see them and I hope they come back to Philadelphia soon, and don't wait another 6 years before doing so.
