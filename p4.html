          <p><h1>Windows Wrenching</h1></p>
          <p>These days I haven’t spent much personal time on Windows, but I still get asked to do the occasional clean/speed boost/tune-up, whatever you want to call it, on someones Windows PC. This blog post is about my technique that I use to preform these simple tasks to keep any Windows PC cleaner, quicker, and as secure as it can be without running globs of BATCH files, and keeping it fairly simple. So if you can follow these simple steps you too can tune any Windows PC to run a little faster, a little smoother, and a little more private.</p>
          <p><strong>Complete all Windows, Java, Adobe updates.</strong> This will make sure your computer is running the latest, bug patched, security patched services available to your machine. I like to schedule updates at night, or manually add them when I know I’m not going to be using the machine. Sometimes, having automatic updates can be a burden when you need to gain access to information quickly, turn on the computer, only to see that spinning update loading screen that Windows uses to tell you “this is going to be a while…”</p>
          <p><strong>*Remove your 3rd Party Antivirus.</strong> Did you buy Antivirus with your computer? Are you paying a monthly or yearly fee associated with a bloated Antivirus? If you have a solid backup solution, there might be an argument to remove your 3rd Party Antivirus all together. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/antivirus-is-bad/" target="_blank">"It Might Be Time to Stop Using Antivirus" - arsTECHNICA</a>. Windows Defender is a security system packaged with Windows and is already on your computer. There are various competing threats on your computer literally every second. Virus’, root kits, malware.. the list goes on however, no one has a biggest interest in your computers health than Windows itself and relying on third-party antivirus is the biggest scam being sold with Windows Computers to date. Antivirus companies like Symantec, subsidize the cost of the computer by offering software being shipped with the computer. These Antivirus programs can act like viruses themselves competing simultaneously with Windows defender and detect eachother as threats, damand higher and higher levels of resources, slowing down system startup and shutdowns, and delaying Windows Updates and eat your battery life.</p>
          <p>The good news is there are many great free Antivirus programs that offer great monitoring and scanning that don't keep your system hostage. So please, at the very least research your current Antivirus if you are experiencing problems, because easiest, most secure and widely used way to clean/speed boost/tune-up is a OS wipe and if you don't already have a solid back-up, or safe initialization restore point, that may be the only option.</p>
          <p><strong>Remove Unwanted Startup Applications.</strong> Another popular problem is the slowing down of a systems startup overtime. Now, a lot of this has to do with planned obsolescence and services requiring more resources over time, but there are some steps that you can take to help subtract some seconds or minutes from your machines startup time. Remove Unwanted Startup Items. There are multiple ways to preform this task:</p>
          <p><i>[1] Remove startup items through Task Manager: [Right-Click the Windows Start button and select Task Manager] or [press Ctrl, Shift, Esc] or [right-click on the empty space of the taskbar, click Task Manger]. When Task Manager is open, click ‘more details’ at the bottom of the window. Click on the Startup tab, right-click on suspect application and select Disable from the pop-up window.</p>
          <p>[2] Remove startup items from Startup Folder: press the Windows Key (next to space bar) and R key simultaneously to open Run command box window. Type “shell:startup” and press Enter key to open the Startup folder. Then press Ctrl-A to select all items in the folder then press the Delete Key.</i></p>
          <p><strong>Clear All temporary files.</strong> Deleting all of your machines Temporary files is the fastest way to free up a significant amount of space on your Windows machine. Again there are multiple ways of viewing and deleting these files:</p>
          <p><i>[1] Click: Start (Window icon)/Settings(gear icon)/System/Storage/This PC/Temporary files and select Temporary files check box. Remove files.</p>
          <p>[2] Press Windows Key (next to spacebar) and R key, simultaneously to open the Run command box. Type “%temp%” and press the Enter key. Select all items and press Delete key. </i></p>
          <p><strong>Adjust System Performance.</strong> Disbling a ton of Windows aesthetic visual effect features can help making your system run smoother. You can adjust these system settings in the Systems Properties settings.</p>
          <p><i>Click: Search, on the taskbar. In the search field type "systempropertiesadvanced". The System Properties window with its advanced tab will open. Under the 'Performance' heading, CLICK [Settings]. The performance Options window with its Visual Effects tab will open. SELECT the 'Adjust for better performance' radio button and click [Apply] then [OK].</i></p>
          <p><strong>Uninstall Toolbars.</strong> There are a lot of ways to uninstall Toolbars from many different developers of web browsers. Most toolbars are enabled through the browsers extension library. Navigate to the enabled extensions section under settings and disable all suspect toolbars. </p>
          <p><strong>Remove PUPS, Potentially Unwanted Programs.</strong> Navigate Start/Settings/Apps, choose program you want to remove and select Uninstall. Restart when all applications you wanted to be removed have been successfully uninstalled.</p>
