      </h1>
      <p>I am an IT professional located in Southeastern Pennsylvania. You can find information on me and my projects <a href="main.html">here</a> and various spots around the web. Currently I am in the beginning stages of iOS App development, writing a small blog and always hacking away, learning something new in this vast and everchanging feild of work.</p>
      <p>Professionally my skills include Windows Server Management, cabling, networking, helpdesk and light web development. I am also proficient in Windows as well as Mac Desktop environments and iOS. I have been dedicated to a small delicatessen and catering company for over 15 years with some of my closest friends.</p>
      <p>Personally, I am a husband and father to a beautiful family. When I'm not spending time with my family or working, I write music with my lifelong best friend. I enjoy drinking coffee and exploring the complexities of the machines that we rely on everyday.</p>
