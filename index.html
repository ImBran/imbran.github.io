      <p>Hi, I'm Brandon Marcelle. I am an IT professional located in Southeastern Pennsylvania, currently looking for career placement. I hold an A.A.S. with honors, in Computer Science from Pennsylvania Institute of Technology, focusing on computer communication technologies and software management. You can find information on me and my projects here and various spots around the web. Currently I am learning python and JS, creating small Safari Extensions, writing a small blog and always hacking away at some script. </p>
      <p>Professionally I have been in computer management and sales. My skills include Windows Server Management, cabling, networking and helpdesk. I am also proficient in Windows as well as Mac Desktop environments and iOS. I have been dedicated to a small delicatessen and catering company for over 15 years with some of my closest friends.</p>
      <p>Personally, I am a husband and father to a beautiful family. When I'm not spending time with my family or working, I write music with my lifelong best friend. I enjoy drinking coffee and exploring the complexities of the machines that we rely on everyday.</p>

        <p>This blog is technology focused, relating to my experiences professionally and personally. It explores topics ranging from Safari Extension Programming to setting up new computers. Occassionally, there will be some yammerings on about homeownership, resonsibilities, philosphy and music. </p>
        <p>*Blog is currently being moved to this space from a third party blog host. Bare with me.</p>
