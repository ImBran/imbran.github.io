      <p>Hi, I'm Brandon K. Marcelle. I am an IT professional located in Southeastern Pennsylvania. You can find information on me and my projects here and various spots around the web. Currently I am in the beginning stages of application and Safari Extension development, writing a small blog and always hacking away, learning something new in this vast and everchanging feild of work.</p>
      <p>Professionally my skills include Windows Server Management, cabling, networking, helpdesk and light web development. I am also proficient in Windows as well as Mac Desktop environments and iOS. I have been dedicated to a small delicatessen and catering company for over 15 years with some of my closest friends.</p>
      <p>Personally, I am a husband and father to a beautiful family. When I'm not spending time with my family or working, I write music with my lifelong best friend. I enjoy drinking coffee and exploring the complexities of the machines that we rely on everyday.</p>

        <p><h2>PassMaker Secure Password Generator</h2></p>
        <p>PassMaker comes in two flavors. PassMaker and PassMaker-DW.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="pssmkr_DW.html" target="_blank">PassMaker-DW</a></strong></p>
        <p>PassMaker-DW is a Diceware passphrase generator built on <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt" target="_blank">The EFFs large list</a> of passphrases. According to the most recent password security research, 6 consecutive random words are the most secure way to create a password, because it turns out humans aren't that good at making <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nick/aaronson-oracle/" target="_blank">unpredicable decisions.</a> PassMaker-DW uses Diceware Theory. It uses randomly generated numbers, similar to a dice roll to generate a key (11111-66666) and value (associated phrase) to create a unique secure passphrase. </p>
        <p><strong><a href="pssmkr_PW.html" target="_blank">PassMaker</a></strong></p>
        <p>PassMaker is a generator for basic common passwords including basic requirements (capital letters, special characters and numbers).  </p>

        <h2>Windows 10 Service Stripper</h2>
        <p>Windows Service Stripper is a BAT I use after new installations of Windows 10. This BAT disables unwanted services, telemetry (Enterprise V. Only), removes app packages (xbox, windows store etc.) and enables GODMODE. Full list in README.</p>
        <p>WSS opens in a CMD window and allows users to choose from a variety of options. Each option will be logged with date and time stamp to log file created by the BAT so a user can see the applications last run. Each option is entered by the user step-by-step and can be quit out of at each pause. </p>
