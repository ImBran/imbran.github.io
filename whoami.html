      <p>Hello, I'm Brandon Marcelle.</p>
      <p>I am an IT professional located in Southeastern Pennsylvania, currently looking for career placement. I hold an A.A.S. with honors, in Computer Science from Pennsylvania Institute of Technology, focusing on computer communication technologies and software management. You can find information on me and my projects here and various spots around the web. Currently I am learning python and JS, creating small Safari Extensions, writing a small blog and always hacking away at some script. </p>
      <p>Professionally I have been in computer management and sales. My skills include Windows Server Management, cabling, networking and helpdesk. I am also proficient in Windows as well as Mac Desktop environments and iOS. If you are looking for a strong independent worker and dependable team member to become a valuable asset, contact me. </p>
      <p>Personally, I am a husband and father who spends too much time behind this glass. I am a musician and enjoy drinking coffee and exploring the complexities of the machines that we rely on everyday.</p></article></div>
