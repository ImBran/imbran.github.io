          <p><h1>iPhone, a PC Replacement</h1></p>
          <p>For two weeks this summer I did a stupid thing. I used my iPhone 7 as my daily workhorse PC while I was in between MacBook purchases, and I gotta tell ya, it wasn’t that bad. Now, which should come to no surprise, I am an apple fan. I have owned a Mac for over 14 years. But before this little experiment I would have doubted that anyone can replace a proper PC with any iOS device especially an iPhone. After my experience however, I am optimistic about the future of computing and how a unified computer experience is closer than I expected, with iOS. Here’s what happened. </p>
          <p>Recently I went through little bit of a setup dilemma. I sold my 2017 15” MacBook Pro after the Keyboardocolypse and bought a 27” iMac. I was dissatisfied with that purchase so decided to return it and temporarily use my phone as my daily driver PC before ordering a brand new surprise 2018 quad core 13” MacBook Pro. During this time, I had to limit my workload a bit but for 2 weeks I went without a real need for a full powered computer.  I used iOS text editors, purchased the 200GB iCloud storage plan for $2.99/month and used a cheap Anker bluetooth keyboard I had laying around. This worked for the first day until the strain of staring at my *small iPhone 7 plus screen for hours became too much of a hassle, so I began AirPlaying my iPhone display to my TV and while it being stretched to fit the bigger screen wasn’t ideal, it suited my needs as a temporary fix. </p>
          <p>After a few days it felt usable. I enjoyed having everything I needed, personally and professionally, on my hip. The ability to rely solely on services (iCloud, AirPlay, AirDrop, AirPrint) was a change for me. I’m someone who likes having a music library and not relying on streaming music services. I barely used airplay and airdrop. I even already owned a monochrome AirPrint enabled printer but only powered it on when I needed it. Just as cutting the cord to a cable TV service changes your relationship with TV, going from a classic desktop/laptop setup to an iOS device comes with some disadvantages. But if your choosing to go all-in, it’s important to welcome all of its advantages and use them to their full potential. </p>
          <p>So is it time to ditch the desk? My answer for most professionals is no. But if you are someone who wouldn’t mind the limitations of being an early adopter and willing to change your relationship with a PC, then go for it.</p>
