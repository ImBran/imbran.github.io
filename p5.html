          <p><h1>PA Siri</h1></p>
          <p>Like most people, I don’t answer my phone unless I recognize the number or am expecting a call. And with iOS’ voicemail transcribe service, it’s even easier to be an introverted recluse. Hooray! And if you’re a self depreciating introverted recluse like me, you don’t like the sound of your recorded voice. Luckily, not only can iOS transcribe your voicemails, but Siri can even record the greeting to your voicemail box.</p>
          <p>No, unfortunately there is no button to push to activate this feature yet, but you can get ahead of the curve and set Siri as your personal assistant yourself with a few steps involving iOS’ Speech Accessibility features. First you need to enable this accessibility feature.</p>
          <p>What you will need: 2 Siri enabled apple devices, your phone to record the greeting and a separate device to speak the greeting message. It is possible to record Siri’s output with the ‘Voice Memo’ app, but the quality will be unacceptable in my opinion.</p>
          <p>Let’s get started!</p>
          <p><strong>Activate Speech Accessibility:</strong></p>
          <p><i>Navigate to [Settings>General>Accessibility>Speech].</i></p>
          <p>Here you can enable two useful features. The first option ’Speak Selection” enables Siri to literally speak any selected text on your device. When you select or select-all any text on your screen, parse over and click ‘speak’ in the context menu. This maybe a better option if you don’t like utilizing all of iOS’ multitouch features. The second option ‘Speak Screen’ enables Siri to speak the entire screen by swiping down from the top of the screen with 2 fingers. This option will enable Siri to speak all the text in the active window of the screen or selected test. This is the faster most preferred method.</p>
          <p>So go ahead and try it out! Open a new note in the Notes app, and make Siri say anything… Okay, play for a minute. Make *it say some inappropriate things….</p>
          <p>Get that out of your system? Good. Now, write a greeting message. Something like, “Hello, you have reached John Doe. This is Siri, his personal virtual assistant. John cannot answer the phone right now so if you leave a name, brief message, or text, he will get back to you as soon as possible.” Play it a few times, add some extra punctuation for fluidity and proper speech pattern timing.</p>
          <p><strong>Record Greeting:</strong></p>
          <p><i>Navigate to [Phone>Voicemail>Greeting]</i></p>
          <p>Enjoy Siri as your new PA!</p>
