            <p><h1>Freeware. No Trials, No Pirating... Just Great Software</h1></p>
            <p>So for years now I have been a huge advocate of using free services and applications, pressing for the usage of the open source movement. The community has grown exponentially and long gone are the days that a user had to be an experienced Linux user to know about the world of open source. This post will serve as a list of fantastic free open sourced tools that can rival their paid counterparts and in some cases exceed them for most everyday users.</p>
            <p>These are just some of the amazing apps available in the free and open sourced community. Please use and share these with people you know and help create the best software by supporting proper competition in the app development market.</p>

            <p><h2>Libre Office</h2></p>
            <p>Word processing is a need for every user. Whether it's for creative writing, students, professionals or family recipes every one needs to jot down something from time to time and Microsoft Office Suites “Microsoft WORD” is the household name that everyone has grown up with. Just like saying “Kleenex” to describe a facial tissue, MS has created a monopoly over the word processing market by using “Word document” to describe a text file. Libre Office is an amazing and quickly adaptable office suite that is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It has a huge community of supporters and developers and has even recently been adopted by government departments and large enterprises. </p>
